# PCA-principal-component-analysis

## 1. Description
The problem set is about Point Distribution Models. 

The first part is to write a function that computes a mean point set and aligns all other point sets to it using a similarity transformation model

The second part is write a function to extract the three most important shape variations using principal components independently by varying between two standard deviations around the mean

## 2. Result
The result and answer are reported in report.pdf file.
